One Sampled T Test

A one sample test of means, compares the mean of a sample test to a pre specified value and tests for a deviation from that value

step 1: Stating the hypothesis
U is the sample mean
U0 is the hypothesized mean
Null Hypothesis: Ho: U = U0
Alternative Hypothesis: H1: U != U0 (Two tailed)
                        H1: U > U0 (One tailed)
                        H1: U < U0 (One tailed)
                        
Step 2: calculate the tcalc
variables needed:
                  sample mean
                  hypothesised mean
                  sample standard deviation
                  sample size
tcalc = (sample mean - hypothesised mean)/ (sample standard deviation / sqrt of sample size)

Step 3: calculate the degrees of freedom
sample size - 1
n-1

step 4: calculate the confidence level
alpha = 100% - confidence level
examples :  95% :100% - 95% = 5% ; 0.05
            99% :100% - 99% = 1% ; 0.01
            90% :100% - 90% = 10%; 0.1
            
Step 5: t tabulated values
Reading values in the table
t table if less than 30 in sample size
z table if more than 30 in sample size
for one tailed: (alpha, df)
for two tailed: (alpha/2, df)

Reading the code in R for the values
qt(area to the left of the critical value, df)

Step 6: Conclusion
if the tcalc value lies in the shaded region we reject the null hypothesis if it lies in the acceptance region
we fail to reject the null hypothesis

Step 7 reading in the one line code in R
t.test(data, mu =)
mu is the null hypothesised mean
if one tailed specify alternative = "less" or "greater"
default confidence level is 95% otherwise specify on conf.level =


Examples on One Sample T test
1.Your company wants to improve sales. Past sales data indicate that the average sales was $100 per transaction. After training your sales force, recent sales data (taken from a sample of 25 salesmen), indicates an average sales of $130, with a standard deviation of $15. Did the training work? Test your hypothesis at 5% alpha level.

stating the hypothesis
H0: Null Hypothesis U = U0: U = 100
H1: ALternative Hypothesis U >U0: U > 100

calculating tcalc
sample size = 25
sample mean = 130
sample sd = 15
alpha = 0.05

tcalc is (sample mean - hypothesised mean)/ (sample sd / sqrt of sample size)
tcalc <- (130 - 100) / (15 / sqrt (25))
tcalc

calculating degrees of freedom
sample size - 1
25 -1 = 24

calculating the confidence level
0.05(given)

the ttab
(0.05, 24) : 1.711

R
qt((1-0.05), 24) ; 1.710882

conclusion
The tcalc value which is ten lies on the right side of the critical value there we reject the null hypothesis

t.test

2. Consider 20 first year resident female doctors drawn at random from one area. Their resting systolic blood pressures were measured using an electronic gadget. The following values were obtained: 128, 118, 144, 133, 132, 111, 149, 139, 136, 126, 127, 115, 142, 140, 131, 132, 122, 119, 129, 128. From previous large studies of women drawn at random from the general healthy public, a resting systolic blood pressure of 120 was predicted as the population mean for the relevant age group.Test to see whether this is the case at 95% significance level.

stating the hypothesis
H0: U = U0: U = 120
H1: U != U: U != 120

calculating the tcalc
sample size = 20
hypothesised mean =120
sbp<-c(128, 118, 144, 133, 132, 111, 149, 139, 136, 126, 127, 115, 142, 140, 131, 132, 122, 119, 129, 128)
sample.sbp.mean<- mean(sbp) : 130.05
sample.sbp.sd<-sd(sbp): 9.960316
tstat <- ((sample.sbp.mean - 120) / (sample.sbp.sd / sqrt(20))) : 4.512404

calculating the degrees of freedom
sample size - 1
20 - 1 = 19

calculating the confidence level
100% - 95% = 5%: 0.05

Ttab
(0.05/2, 19): 
R
qt(0.05/2, 19): -2.093024, 2.093024

Conclusion
the tcalc lies on the right side of the positive vritical value therefore we reject the null hypothesis that the average sbp mean is not same

t.test(sbp, mu = 120):
One Sample t-test

data:  sbp
t = 4.5124, df = 19, p-value = 0.0002384
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 120
95 percent confidence interval:
 125.3884 134.7116
sample estimates:

Two Sampled T Test

A two sample test of means, compares the means of two different datasets but independent population

step 1: Stating the hypothesis
U1 is the mean of first group
U2 is the mean of the second group
Null Hypothesis: Ho: U1 - U2 = 0
Alternative Hypothesis: H1: U1 - u2 != 0 (Two tailed)
                        H1: U1 - U2 > 0: U1> U2 (One tailed)
                        H1: U1 - U2 < 0: U1< U2 (One tailed)
                        
Step 2: calculate the tcalc
variables needed:
                  sample mean
                  hypothesised mean
                  sample standard deviation
                  sample size
We need to determine whether the datasets have equal or unequal variance we use var.test(data1, data2)
if the pvalue of the Ftest is greater then the alpha value we assume equal variances otherwise we assume unequal variances
Equal Variance
sp: pooled standard variance
sp = sqrt(((n1 - 1)*s1^2 + (n2 - 1)*s2^2)/n1 +n2 -2)
t = (mean 1 - mean 2 - difference of hypothesised mean) / (sp * sqrt (1/n1 + 1/n2))

unequal variance
t = (mean 1 - mean 2 - difference in hypothesised means)/ sqrt(s1^2/n1 s2^2/n2)
df
Step 3: calculate the degrees of freedom
for equal variance:
ndf = 1 + n2 -2

for unequal variance:
df =(s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2)^2 /( ((1/n1 -1)*(s1^2/n1)^2) + (1/n2 - 1 *(s2^2/n2)^2)) 

step 4: calculate the confidence level
alpha = 100% - confidence level
examples :  95% :100% - 95% = 5% ; 0.05
            99% :100% - 99% = 1% ; 0.01
            90% :100% - 90% = 10%; 0.1
            
Step 5: t tabulated values
Reading values in the table
t table if less than 30 in sample size
z table if more than 30 in sample size
for one tailed: (alpha, df)
for two tailed: (alpha/2, df)

Reading the code in R for the values
qt(area to the left of the critical value, df)

Step 6: Conclusion
if the tcalc value lies in the shaded region we reject the null hypothesis if it lies in the acceptance region
we fail to reject the null hypothesis

Step 7 reading in the one line code in R
t.test(data1, data2,)
var.equal = T
if one tailed specify alternative = "less" or "greater"
default confidence level is 95% otherwise specify on conf.level =


Example Question
From the Wafanyikazi dataset, test whether there is a difference in the mean age between single females and married females. First carry out the calculations in R, then run the t.test() code to confirm the answer. The conclusions should be the same. 

reading in the dataset
wafanyikazi <-read.csv("C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\Amandla\\wafanyikazi.csv")
wafanyikazi

(age.single.females <- wafanyikazi %>% 
filter(Gender == "Female") %>% 
filter(Marital_Status == "Single") %>% 
select(Age) %>% 
pull())

age.married.females<- wafanyikazi %>% 
filter( Gender == "Female") %>% 
filter(Marital_Status=="Married") %>% 
select(Age) %>% 
pull()

stating the hypothesis
Null Hypothesis: H0 U1 - U2 = 0
Alternative Hypothesis: H1: U1 - U2 != 0

testing whether the population has equal or unequal variance
var.test(age.single.females, age.married.females)

F test to compare two variances

data:  age.single.females and age.married.females
F = 1.0106, num df = 73, denom df = 84, p-value = 0.9588
alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.6487445 1.5854217
sample estimates:
ratio of variances 
          1.010586
          
since the pvalue is greater than the alpha value, we assume equal variances

calculating the tcalc
n1<- length (age.single.females) : 74
n2<- length(age.married.females): 85
s1 <- sd(age.single.females) : 9.924866
s2<- sd(age.married.females) : 9.872748
barx1<- mean(age.single.females) :  35.17568
barx2<- mean(age.married.females): 33.87059

pooled standard variance
psd<- (((n1 - 1)*s1^2) + ((n2 - 1)* s2^2)) / (n1 + n2 - 2) : 97.95091
tcalculated<- (barx1 - barx2 - 0) / (psd * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2)) : 0.08380268

calculating the degrees of freedom
n1 + n2 - 2 = 157

calculating the confidence level 
100% - 95% = 5%  0.05

the ttab
(0.05/2, 157)
R
qt(0.05/2, 157) : -1.975189, 1.975189

Conclusion 
The tcalc value lies in between the critical values therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis

Paired T Test
it is also known as dependent sample t test
it is a statistical procedure used to determine whether the mean difference between 2 sets of observations is zero
in this test each subject is measured twice, resulting in pairs of observations
eg. Rat before calss and same Rat after class

step 1: Stating the hypothesis
U1 is the sample mean of score before
U2 is the sample mean of score after
Null Hypothesis: Ho: U2 -U1 = 0
Alternative Hypothesis: H1: U2 - U1 != 0 (Two tailed)
                        H1: U2 - U1 > 0 : U2 > U1(One tailed)
                        H1: U2 - U1 < 0 :U2 < U1(One tailed)
                        
Step 2: calculate the tcalc
variables needed:
                xi= pre scores
                yi = post scores
                di = difference in scores : yi - xi
                mean(di)
                sd(di)
                sample size(di)
tcalc = (mean of difference - hypothesised difference)/ (sd of difference / sqrt(sample size of difference))

Step 3: calculate the degrees of freedom
sample size - 1
n-1

step 4: calculate the confidence level
alpha = 100% - confidence level
examples :  95% :100% - 95% = 5% ; 0.05
            99% :100% - 99% = 1% ; 0.01
            90% :100% - 90% = 10%; 0.1
            
Step 5: t tabulated values
Reading values in the table
t table if less than 30 in sample size
z table if more than 30 in sample size
for one tailed: (alpha, df)
for two tailed: (alpha/2, df)

Reading the code in R for the values
qt(area to the left of the critical value, df)

Step 6: Conclusion
if the tcalc value lies in the shaded region we reject the null hypothesis if it lies in the acceptance region
we fail to reject the null hypothesis

Step 7: Verifier
t.test(post data, pre data, paired = TRUE)
if one tailed specify alternative = "less" or "greater"
default confidence level is 95% otherwise specify on conf.level =

Example Question
As an example of data, 10 mice received a treatment X during 3 months. We want to know whether the treatment X has an impact on the weight of the mice.
To answer to this question, the weight of the 10 mice has been measured before and after the treatment. This gives us 10 sets of values before treatment and 10 sets of values after treatment from measuring twice the weight of the same mice.
before <-c(200.1, 190.9, 192.7, 213, 241.4, 196.9, 172.2, 185.5, 205.2, 193.7)
after <-c(392.9, 393.2, 345.1, 393, 434, 427.9, 422, 383.9, 392.3, 352.2)

stating the hypothesis
H0: U2 - U1 = 0
H1: U2 - U1 !=0

calculating t calc
variables needed:
              diff <- after - before 
              diff.mean <- mean(diff) : 194.49
              diff.sd <- sd(diff) : 29.45111
              diff.length <- length(diff) :10
tcalcu <- (diff.mean - 0) / (diff.sd/ sqrt(diff.length)) :20.88313

calculating degrees of freedom
10 - 1 = 9

calculating confidence level
100% - 95% = 5%  0.05

Reading Values
ttab
(0.05/2, 9): 2.262

R
qt(0.05/2,9) : -2.262157, 2.262157

conclusion 
since the tcalc value lies on the right side of the positive critical value we reject the null hypothesis that the treatment does not have an impact on the weight of the mice
